                        At the young age of seventeen, Maisie Hurtado went from raising a
                        flock of sheep through the Future Farmers of America to owning her
                        dream business.

                        As a fourth generation Chicoan and almond farmer’s daughter,
                        agricultural lifestyle was ingrained in Maisie. The simple things in
                        life were enjoyably introduced from her parents through daily chores
                        and close encounters with nature’s life cycles, both plant and
                        animal. Cooking also came naturally to Maisie who liked to experiment
                        in the kitchen. As conversations at the family dinner table recurred
                        about the lack of fresh quality almonds on grocery store shelves, so
                        inherently did the idea for Maisie Jane’s.

                        five baked nut products were produced.

                        It took 22 years for Maisie Jane’s to get to the multi national
                        almond producer that it is now. With acres of farmland to manage
                        along with buying locally owned almonds from growers, the job may
                        feel overwhelming to some. With empowerment from her husband Isidro,
                        who works on the manufacturing side of things, the two have joined
                        their expertise to keep it all running smoothly.

                        example we now do a lot of co packing for other companies. Keep your
